Project completed on the Ising Model for 'Mini Project 1' for MATH7203 Numerical Analysis 1 at Northeastern University

Running `IsingModel.py` directly will initiate an animation of the model via `ising.animate()`. Note the animation function parameters, and be sure the `savevideo` and `showanimation` props are passed properly for your desired output. 

A full framework with improved methods and better usability is a WIP.
